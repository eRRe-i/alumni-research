>But higher education institutions that wish to track graduates face considerable challenges. The development of a tracking approach is time- and resource-intensive. It involves drafting and testing a questionnaire, deciding on the target groups and how to reach them, and collecting and processing results, etc. The quality of responses is also a concern, as the answers of graduates are subjective and could be affected, for example, by an economic crisis or high unemployment rates. The survey may not produce results that can or should be immediately applied. Another drawback is the lack of readily comparable data, given that other institutions might use different questionnaires, indicators and methods. ([[bibliografia/gaebel2012tracking]], p√°g 40)
