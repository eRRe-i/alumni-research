> 3. Complex service-package offering systems (Australia, Chile, South-America, Colombia) The countries in this category have a radically different GCTS form the previous ones. The feed back and presentation of the results are totally and organically connected to higher education stake-holders’ needed information. A lot of information is needed to decide wisely when choosing among the available HE trainings. On the one hand, administrative questions arise (how and where to apply, the type and level of training); on the other hand, the possible conditions and related data for long-term career and work are in focus. This comprehensive approach allows the stakeholders to search autonomously among the data, and perform a multi-criteria search. Thanks to the data collection an indirect recruitment or head-hunting activity can be offered which:
> ▪ is good for the graduates, as they can switch jobs more easily, 
> ▪ is good for the employers, as it costs less to find the proper employee,
> ▪ is suitable for the survey responsible organizations, as a higher response rate can be achieved, and the graduates are interested in updating their data, 
> ▪ is good for HE institutions, as not big administrative staff is needed to maintain the system at institutional level, which also means a cost-efficiency,
> ▪ is useful for the governments, as private companies can bear some of the costs and all the data can be collected.
> 
> We believe that this approach is the one that makes the graduate career tracking system sustainable and successful.
